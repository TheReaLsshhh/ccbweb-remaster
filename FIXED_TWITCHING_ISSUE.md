# Fixed Twitching Issue in HomePage

## Problem
The HomePage was experiencing a "twitching" effect, particularly noticeable in the footer area. This was caused by several factors:

1. Dynamic navbar behavior causing layout shifts during scrolling
2. Complex CSS animations and transitions that interfered with scroll performance
3. Inconsistent positioning of elements during scroll events
4. Conflicting scroll-padding and scroll-margin values

## Solution
I've implemented a comprehensive fix by creating optimized versions of the HomePage component and its associated CSS files:

### 1. HomePageOptimized.js
- Simplified component structure
- Removed complex scroll event handlers that were causing performance issues
- Maintained all UI/UX elements and information

### 2. HomePageOptimized.css
- Streamlined CSS with focus on performance
- Removed conflicting animations that caused layout shifts
- Simplified section styling to prevent twitching
- Optimized carousel component for smoother performance

### 3. Updated Dependencies
- Modified App.js to use the new optimized HomePage
- Updated Navbar.js to remove dynamic visibility behavior
- Updated footer.css to ensure stable positioning
- Cleaned up index.css to remove conflicting styles

## Key Changes

### Navbar.js
- Removed dynamic `isTopBarVisible` behavior
- Set top bar to always be visible with `top-bar-visible` class
- Simplified active page tracking

### HomePageOptimized.js
- Created from scratch with performance in mind
- Removed complex scroll event listeners
- Maintained all content and UI elements
- Simplified state management

### HomePageOptimized.css
- Removed complex animations that caused layout shifts
- Simplified section styling
- Optimized carousel for better performance
- Ensured consistent positioning of all elements

### index.css
- Fixed scroll-padding-top values
- Removed conflicting styles
- Simplified section animations
- Fixed CSS syntax errors

## Results
The twitching effect has been completely eliminated while maintaining:
- All UI/UX elements
- All informational content
- Visual appeal and design consistency
- Responsive behavior across devices
- Smooth scrolling experience

## Testing
The optimized HomePage has been tested and verified to:
- Load without errors
- Display all content correctly
- Function properly on mobile and desktop
- Eliminate the twitching effect completely

## Deployment
To use the optimized version:
1. The App.js file has already been updated to use HomePageOptimized
2. All CSS files have been updated with optimized styles
3. The original files are preserved as backup
